## Learning Goals

1. Improve your knowledge about core JavaScript concepts
2. Are able to build progressively enhanced frontend components

### In practice

- Know about the different versions of JavaScript
- Know the building blocks of JavaScript
- Gain awareness of the inner workings of JavaScript

## Assignment

First your knowledge is validated by explaining the core JavaScript concepts; Scope, Context, Hoisting and Closure in the wiki of the main repository. Second there is an oral test where you present your final project, your progressively enhanced component.

## Grading

This project consists of two parts: one individual assessment A1 (50%) and another individual assessment A2 (50%). Both assignments get a grade (1-10). The two assignments can compensate each other.
