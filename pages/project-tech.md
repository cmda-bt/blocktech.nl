## Description

Project Tech is a first stepping stone for you to become a well-rounded web developer (or a designer with knowledge of how things are made). You'll build a dynamic prototype of a matching app.

We’ll focus on what it means to be a web developer, the current landscape of that space, and topics such as privacy, security, diversity, inclusion, accessibility, communication and team work.

You also learn about the more “soft” and “hard” skills such as the command line, text editors, version control, build tools, and code quality.

## Learning Goals

1. You can design a dynamic web application
2. You can research topics in web development (such as code standards, code style, version control, documentation etc.)
3. You can collaborate with other developers using version control
4. You can recognize good quality code and review other people's code.

### In practice

- Version control with Git
- Write docs in Markdown
- Navigate the command line
- Set up a Github repository
- Adhere to code standards using linters
- Customize your local machine
- Collaborate on GitHub

## Assignment

For this project you'll build a dynamic and working prototype of a matching application made with Node.js, a database, HTML, CSS, and client-side JS.

You will do research on existing matching apps and come up with a job story. You then start sketching and designing the components within your job story. You end with a working prototype of your job story using knowledge and skills acquired in backend and frontend.

## Grading

This project consists of two parts: first an individual assignment (60%), then a team assignment (40%). Both assignments get a grade (1-10) and both assignments have different weights in the calculation of the final grade of the project (60% for a1 individual, 40% for a2 team). The two assignments can compensate each other.

This project is highly participatory. You are expected to contribute to discussions and give feedback to peers. Attendance to class is not compulsory. 80% of success is showing up though, so show up.
