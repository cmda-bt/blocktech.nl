## Description

In Backend we peek behind the curtains and inspect what’s behind the web. You build web apps with Node.js, communicate with HTTP, and store data in a database with MongoDB. In this course you’ll advance your web dev skills. You’ll learn to use computers to actually make what you design work: people can actually fill in forms, like things, and upload files.

## Learning Goals

1. You can build web apps with Node
2. You can use packages from npm
3. You can communicate over http
4. You can render data server-side with templating
5. You can store data in a database

### In practice

- Understand Node principles
- Use packages from npm
- Use web frameworks like express
- Communicate over HTTP
- Render data server-side with templating
- Upload data and files to servers
- Store data in a MongoDB database
- Use localStorage to store data client-side

## Assignment

For this project you'll build a dynamic and working prototype of a matching application made with Node.js, NPM, Express, Templating, MongoDB, and Sessions. People can actually fill in forms, like things, and upload files.

## Grading

This project consists of two parts: first an individual assignment (60%), then a team assignment (40%). Both assignments get a grade (1-10) and both assignments have different weights in the calculation of the final grade of the project (60% for a1 individual, 40% for a2 team). The two assignments can compensate each other.

This project is highly participatory. You are expected to contribute to discussions and give feedback to peers. Attendance to class is not compulsory. 80% of success is showing up though, so show up.
