## Description

In Backend we peek behind the curtains and inspect what’s behind the web. You build web apps with Node.js, communicate with HTTP, and store data in a database with MongoDB. In this course you’ll advance your web dev skills. You’ll learn to use computers to actually make what you design work: people can actually fill in forms, like things, and upload files.

## Feedback

> Back-end was challenging but the labs and lessons were very practical. The feedback from the Teachers was clear and it was obvious they had lots of knowledge and were able to transfer that onto the students.” -- Martijn Keesmaat
